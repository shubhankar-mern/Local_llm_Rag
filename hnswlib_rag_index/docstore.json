Search engines are getting better at running and indexing JavaScript apps, but it's much better if we can send them content instead of letting them figure it out.\nThe solution to both of those problems is server rendering, also called static pre-rendering.\nNext.js is one React framework to do all of this in a very simple way, but it's not limited to this.

Instead of generating one single JavaScript file containing all the app code, the app is broken up automatically by Next.js in several different resources.\nLoading a page only loads the JavaScript necessary for that particular page.\nNext.js does that by analyzing the resources imported.\nIf only one of your pages imports the Axios library, for example, that specific page will include the library in its bundle.\nThis ensures your first page load is as fast as it can be, and only future page loads (if they will ever be triggered) will send the JavaScript needed to the client.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":164,"to":173}}}}],["8",{"pageContent":"This ensures your first page load is as fast as it can be, and only future page loads (if they will ever be triggered) will send the JavaScript needed to the client.\nThere is one notable exception.

appears in the viewport (which means it's visible to the website user), Next.js prefetches the URL it points to, as long as it's a local link (on your website), making the application super fast to the viewer.\nThis behavior is only being triggered in production mode (we'll talk about this in-depth later), which means you have to stop the application if you are running it with npm run dev,

trigger a routing change programmatically.\nIn this case, you can access the Next.js Router directly, provided in the next/router package, and call its push() method.\nHere's an example of accessing the router:\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n\nexport default () => {\n  const router = useRouter()\n

In particular, the thing we are interested into now is that we get the query object, the one we used previously to get the post id.\nSo we can get it using the object destructuring syntax:\nPost.getInitialProps = ({ query }) => {\n  //...\n}","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":696,"to":732}}}}],["49",{"pageContent":"Now we can return the post from this function:\nPost.getInitialProps = ({ query }) => {\n  return {\n    post: posts[query.id]\n  }\n}\n\nAnd we can also remove the import of useRouter, and we get the post from the props property passed to the Post component:\nimport posts from '../../posts.json'\n\nconst Post = props => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{props.post.title}</h1>\n      <p>{props.post.content}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nPost.getInitialProps = ({ query }) => {\n  return {\n    post: posts[query.id]\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Post\n\nNow there will be no error, and SSR will be working as expected, as you can see checking view source:\n\nThe getInitialProps function will be executed on the server side, but also on the client side, when we navigate to a new page using the Link component as we did.\nIt's important to note that getInitialProps gets, in the context object it receives, in addition to the query object these other properties:","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":734,"to":764}}}}],["50",{"pageContent":"pathname: the path section of URL\nasPath - String of the actual path (including the query) shows in the browser\n\nwhich in the case of calling http://localhost:3000/blog/test will respectively result to:\n\n/blog/[id]\n/blog/test\n\nAnd in the case of server side rendering, it will also receive:\n\nreq: the HTTP request object\nres: the HTTP response object\nerr: an error object","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":766,"to":778}}}}],["51",{"pageContent":"/blog/[id]\n/blog/test\n\nAnd in the case of server side rendering, it will also receive:\n\nreq: the HTTP request object\nres: the HTTP response object\nerr: an error object\n\nreq and res will be familiar to you if you've done any Node.js coding.\nCSS\nHow do we style React components in Next.js?\nWe have a lot of freedom, because we can use whatever library we prefer.\nBut Next.js comes with styled-jsx built-in, because that's a library built by the same people working on Next.js.\nAnd it's a pretty cool library that provides us scoped CSS, which is great for maintainability because the CSS is only affecting the component it's applied to.\nI think this is a great approach at writing CSS, without the need to apply additional libraries or preprocessors that add complexity.\nTo add CSS to a React component in Next.js we insert it inside a snippet in the JSX, which start with\n<style jsx>{`\n\nand ends with\n`}</style>","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":771,"to":791}}}}],["52",{"pageContent":"and ends with\n`}</style>\n\nInside this weird blocks we write plain CSS, as we'd do in a .css file:\n<style jsx>{`\n  h1 {\n    font-size: 3rem;\n  }\n`}</style>\n\nYou write it inside the JSX, like this:\nconst Index = () => (\n  <div>\n        <h1>Home page</h1>\n\n        <style jsx>{`\n          h1 {\n            font-size: 3rem;\n          }\n        `}</style>\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default Index\n\nInside the block we can use interpolation to dynamically change the values. For example here we assume a size prop is being passed by the parent component, and we use it in the styled-jsx block:\nconst Index = props => (\n  <div>\n        <h1>Home page</h1>\n\n        <style jsx>{`\n          h1 {\n            font-size: ${props.size}rem;\n          }\n        `}</style>\n  </div>\n)\n\nIf you want to apply some CSS globally, not scoped to a component, you add the global keyword to the style tag:\n<style jsx global>{`\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n`}</style>","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":790,"to":833}}}}],["53",{"pageContent":"If you want to apply some CSS globally, not scoped to a component, you add the global keyword to the style tag:\n<style jsx global>{`\nbody {\n  margin: 0;\n}\n`}</style>\n\nIf you want to import an external CSS file in a Next.js component, you have to first install @zeit/next-css:\nnpm install @zeit/next-css\n\nand then create a configuration file in the root of the project, called next.config.js, with this content:\nconst withCSS = require('@zeit/next-css')\nmodule.exports = withCSS()\n\nAfter restarting the Next app, you can now import CSS like you normally do with JavaScript libraries or components:\nimport '../style.css'\n\nYou can also import a SASS file directly, using the @zeit/next-sass library instead.\nPopulating the head tag with custom tags\nFrom any Next.js page component, you can add information to the page header.\nThis is handy when:\n\nyou want to customize the page title\nyou want to change a meta tag","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":828,"to":851}}}}],["54",{"pageContent":"you want to customize the page title\nyou want to change a meta tag\n\nHow can you do so?\nInside every component you can import the Head component from next/head and include it in your component JSX output:\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n\nconst House = props => (\n  <div>\n    <Head>\n      <title>The page title</title>\n    </Head>\n    {/* the rest of the JSX */}\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default House","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":850,"to":866}}}}],["55",{"pageContent":"const House = props => (\n  <div>\n    <Head>\n      <title>The page title</title>\n    </Head>\n    {/* the rest of the JSX */}\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default House\n\nYou can add any HTML tag you'd like to appear in the <head> section of the page.\nWhen mounting the component, Next.js will make sure the tags inside Head are added to the heading of the page. Same when unmounting the component, Next.js will take care of removing those tags.\nAdding a wrapper component\nAll the pages on your site look more or less the same. There's a chrome window, a common base layer, and you just want to change what's inside.\nThere's a nav bar, a sidebar, and then the actual content.\nHow do you build such system in Next.js?\nThere are 2 ways. One is using a Higher Order Component, by creating a components/Layout.js component:\nexport default Page => {\n  return () => (\n    <div>\n      <nav>\n        <ul>....</ul>\n      </hav>\n      <main>\n        <Page />\n      </main>\n    </div>\n  )\n}","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":857,"to":886}}}}],["56",{"pageContent":"In there we can import separate components for heading and/or sidebar, and we can also add all the CSS we need.\nAnd you use it in every page like this:\nimport withLayout from '../components/Layout.js'\n\nconst Page = () => <p>Here's a page!</p>\n\nexport default withLayout(Page)\n\nBut I found this works only for simple cases, where you don't need to call getInitialProps() on a page.\nWhy?\nBecause getInitialProps() gets only called on the page component. But if we export the Higher Order Component withLayout() from a page, Page.getInitialProps() is not called. withLayout.getInitialProps() would.\nTo avoid unnecessarily complicating our codebase, the alternative approach is to use props:\nexport default props => (\n  <div>\n    <nav>\n      <ul>....</ul>\n    </hav>\n    <main>\n      {props.content}\n    </main>\n  </div>\n)\n\nand in our pages now we use it like this:\nimport Layout from '../components/Layout.js'\n\nconst Page = () => (\n  <Layout content={(\n    <p>Here's a page!</p>\n  )} />\n)","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":888,"to":918}}}}],["57",{"pageContent":"and in our pages now we use it like this:\nimport Layout from '../components/Layout.js'\n\nconst Page = () => (\n  <Layout content={(\n    <p>Here's a page!</p>\n  )} />\n)\n\nThis approach lets us use getInitialProps() from within our page component, with the only downside of having to write the component JSX inside the content prop:\nimport Layout from '../components/Layout.js'\n\nconst Page = () => (\n  <Layout content={(\n    <p>Here's a page!</p>\n  )} />\n)\n\nPage.getInitialProps = ({ query }) => {\n  //...\n}","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":911,"to":931}}}}],["58",{"pageContent":"const Page = () => (\n  <Layout content={(\n    <p>Here's a page!</p>\n  )} />\n)\n\nPage.getInitialProps = ({ query }) => {\n  //...\n}\n\nAPI Routes\nIn addition to creating page routes, which means pages are served to the browser as Web pages, Next.js can create API routes.\nThis is a very interesting feature because it means that Next.js can be used to create a frontend for data that is stored and retrieved by Next.js itself, transferring JSON via fetch requests.\nAPI routes live under the /pages/api/ folder and are mapped to the /api endpoint.\nThis feature is very useful when creating applications.\nIn those routes, we write Node.js code (rather than React code). It's a paradigm shift, you move from the frontend to the backend, but very seamlessly.\nSay you have a /pages/api/comments.js file, whose goal is to return the comments of a blog post as JSON.\nSay you have a list of comments stored in a comments.json file:\n[\n  {\n    \"comment\": \"First\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"comment\": \"Nice post\"\n  }\n]","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":923,"to":948}}}}],["59",{"pageContent":"Here's a sample code, which returns to the client the list of comments:\nimport comments from './comments.json'\n\nexport default (req, res) => {\n  res.status(200).json(comments)\n}\n\nIt will listen on the /api/comments URL for GET requests, and you can try calling it using your browser:\n\nAPI routes can also use dynamic routing like pages, use the [] syntax to create a dynamic API route, like /pages/api/comments/[id].js which will retrieve the comments specific to a post id.\nInside the [id].js you can retrieve the id value by looking it up inside the req.query object:\nimport comments from '../comments.json'\n\nexport default (req, res) => {\n  res.status(200).json({ post: req.query.id, comments })\n}\n\nHeres you can see the above code in action:","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":950,"to":967}}}}],["60",{"pageContent":"export default (req, res) => {\n  res.status(200).json({ post: req.query.id, comments })\n}\n\nHeres you can see the above code in action:\n\nIn dynamic pages, you'd need to import useRouter from next/router, then get the router object using const router = useRouter(), and then we'd be able to get the id value using router.query.id.\nIn the server-side it's all easier, as the query is attached to the request object.\nIf you do a POST request, all works in the same way - it all goes through that default export.\nTo separate POST from GET and other HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE), lookup the req.method value:\nexport default (req, res) => {\n  switch (req.method) {\n    case 'GET':\n      //...\n      break\n    case 'POST':\n      //...\n      break\n    default:\n      res.status(405).end() //Method Not Allowed\n      break\n  }\n}","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":963,"to":985}}}}],["61",{"pageContent":"In addition to req.query and req.method we already saw, we have access to cookies by referencing req.cookies, the request body in req.body.\nUnder the hoods, this is all powered by Micro, a library that powers asynchronous HTTP microservices, made by the same team that built Next.js.\nYou can make use of any Micro middleware in our API routes to add more functionality.\nRun code only on the server side or client side\nIn your page components, you can execute code only in the server-side or on the client-side, by checking the window property.\nThis property is only existing inside the browser, so you can check\nif (typeof window === 'undefined') {\n\n}\n\nand add the server-side code in that block.\nSimilarly, you can execute client-side code only by checking\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n\n}","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":987,"to":1001}}}}],["62",{"pageContent":"}\n\nJS Tip: We use the typeof operator here because we can't detect a value to be undefined in other ways.

A client-side bundle will not include the content wrapped into a if (typeof window === 'undefined') {} block.\nDeploying the production version\nDeploying an app is always left last in tutorials.\nHere I want to introduce it early, just because it's so easy to deploy a Next.js app that we can dive into it now, and then move on to other more complex topics later on.\nRemember in the \"How to install Next.js\" chapter I told you to add those 3 lines to the package.json script section:\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"dev\": \"next\",\n  \"build\": \"next build\",\n  \"start\": \"next start\"\n}","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":1001,"to":1013}}}}],["63",{"pageContent":"We used npm run dev up to now, to call the next command installed locally in node_modules/next/dist/bin/next.

Instead of importing Moment at the component level, we perform an async import inside getInitialProps, and we calculate the value to send to the component.Remember that we can't return complex objects inside the getInitialProps() returned object, so we calculate the date inside it:\nimport posts from '../../posts.json'\n\nconst Post = props => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{props.post.title}</h1>\n      <p>Published on {props.date}</p>\n      <p>{props.post.content}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}","metadata":{"source":"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-next-js-handbook/","title":"The Next.js Handbook – Learn Next.js for Beginners","loc":{"lines":{"from":1143,"to":1157}}}}],["73",{"pageContent":"const Post = props => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{props.post.title}</h1>\n      <p>Published on {props.date}</p>\n      <p>{props.post.content}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nPost.getInitialProps = async ({ query }) => {\n  const moment = (await import('moment')).default()\n  return {\n    date: moment.format('dddd D MMMM YYYY'),\n    post: posts[query.id]\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Post\n\nSee that special call to .default() after await import?
